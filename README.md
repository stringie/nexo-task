Build a simple DApp like CryptoKitties. Donâ€™t care much about the details. Implement what you think is essential. As a minimum:

-   Smart contract with the data and the business logic
-   Web App for interaction with the smart contract.
-   Deploy the smart contract on Kovan network.
-   Deploy the web app on IPFS.
-   Provide information about the development environment and tests for the smart contract.
